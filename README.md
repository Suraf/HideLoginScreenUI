**HideLoginScreenUI** repository contains files to replace elements with transparent ones for the _World of Warcraft_ login screen.

### How to add?

Just place the folders, `Fonts` and `Interface`, in the _World of Warcraft_ install folder (i.e. `World of Warcraft/_retail_`).

* `_retail_` = Retail (i.e. Dragonflight)
* `_ptr_` = Retail Public Test Realm
* `_xptr_` = Retail Public Test Realm
* `_classic_` = Classic branch (e.g. Wrath of the Lich King Classic)
* `_classic_ptr_` = Classic branch PTR (e.g. Wrath of the Lich King Classic)
* `_classic_era_` = World of Warcraft: Classic
* `_classic_era_ptr_` = World of Warcraft: Classic PTR
* `_beta_` = Retail beta (i.e. Dragonflight beta)

### How to remove?

Just delete the folder `Fonts` and delete all the folders in `Interface` folder (except the `AddOns` folder).

### Why?

I use this to get clean screenshots of the login screen for use on the [Warcraft Wiki](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_Wiki:About) article, [Loading screen](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Loading_screen), which contains all the past and current looks with and without the interface. Others may just want to check it out.
